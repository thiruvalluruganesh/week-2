<body>
    <p>In HTML, certain characters like &lt;, &gt;, and &amp; have special meanings. For example, the &lt; character is used to denote the beginning of a tag, while the &gt; character marks its end. The &amp; symbol is used to represent an ampersand itself. To display these characters in plain text, you must use their entities, such as &amp;lt;, &amp;gt;, and &amp;amp;, respectively.</p>
